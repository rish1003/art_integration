A triple favored celebration, Saga Dawa is reckoned as one of the godliest festivals
in Sikkim especially for the Mahayana Buddhists. On this particular day, 
the Buddhists visit the monasteries, offer the prayers and butter lamps 
as they were the three remarkable events associated with the existence of Buddha 
which is celebrated at this event. This particular is held on the full moon of the
4th month of the Buddhist calendar either at the end of May or at the beginning of June.
This festival takes place in Gangtok.
