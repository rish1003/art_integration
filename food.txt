The food of the people of Sikkim indicates the culture of this state which is
a mélange of India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet. 
Sikkim food mainly comprises noodles, Gundruk and Sinki soups,
thukpas, tomato achar pickle, traditional cottage cheese, fermented soybean, 
Bamboo shoot, fermented rice product and some other fermented dishes 
owing to its very cold climate. Rice is, however, the staple food of the state.
Momos, also known as dumplings and wantons are favorites among the 
Sikkimese people as well as the tourists. When it comes to non-vegetarian food, 
they prefer fish, beef, and pork. Steamed and boiled food items are
mainly found here with not so much utilization of masalas but other local spices and herbs.
And the people of Sikkim mostly prefer some drinks along
with the food such as local beer, whiskey, and rum.
