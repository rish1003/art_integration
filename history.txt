The Kingdom of Sikkim was founded by the Namgyal dynasty in the 17th century.
It was ruled by Buddhist priest-kings known as the Chogyal.
It became a princely state of British India in 1890.
Following Indian independence, Sikkim continued its protectorate status with
the Union of India after 1947, and the Republic of India after 1950.
It enjoyed the highest literacy rate and per capita income among Himalayan states.
In 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in front of the Chogyal's palace.
In 1975, after the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok, a referendum
was held that led to the deposition of the monarchy and Sikkim joining India as its 22nd state.
