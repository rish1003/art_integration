Nestling in the Himalayan mountains, the state of Sikkim is characterised by mountainous terrain.
Almost the entire state is hilly, with an elevation ranging from 280 metres (920 ft) in the south 
at border with West Bengal to 8,586 metres (28,169 ft) in northern peaks near Nepal and Tibet.
It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China in the north and northeast, Bhutan in the east,
Nepal in the west, and West Bengal in the south. Sikkim is also close to India's Siliguri Corridor
near Bangladesh. A part of the Eastern Himalaya, Sikkim is notable for its biodiversity,
including alpine and subtropical climates, as well as being a host to Kangchenjunga,
the highest peak in India and third highest on Earth.
