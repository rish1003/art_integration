Limboo or Subba is a traditional folk dance of the Sikkimese.
In this dance, the dancers hang the 'Chyap-brungs', 
a musical instrument around their necks. The drum is beaten with 
a palm on one side and with a stick on the other side. 
The fancy trick creates two different sounds. 
The dance comprises of complex footwork that is tuned with the beats of Chyap-Brung.
